TIC-TAC-TOE GAME-PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION:

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

HOW TO PLAY:

Run the tic_tac_toe.py file using a Python interpreter.

The game will display an empty 3x3 grid.

Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers where they want to place their mark.

The first player uses the X mark, and the second player uses the O mark.

The game will validate the moves and display the updated grid after each turn.

The game will continue until one player wins or there is a tie (no more available moves).

GAME FUNCTIONS:

The implementation of the game consists of the following functions:

'DrawBoard()'

This function is responsible for displaying the game board. It prints a 3x3 grid with the current marks made by the players.

'checkposition(row, col)'

This function checks if a position on the board is empty or already occupied by a player's mark. It takes the row and column numbers as parameters and returns True if the position is empty, and False otherwise.

'checkwin()'

This function checks if there is a winning combination on the board. It examines all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals) and returns True if any player has won, and False otherwise.
